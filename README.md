# DiabVision

DiabVision is a classification tool designed to analyze retinal images and determine whether they exhibit signs of diabetic retinopathy. This repository contains two main files:

1. **diabVision_binary:** This file contains the code for the binary classification model. Given a retinal image as input, it predicts whether the image shows signs of diabetic retinopathy or not.

2. **diabVision:** This file utilizes the binary classification model to predict not only whether an image has diabetic retinopathy but also the severity or level of the condition.
